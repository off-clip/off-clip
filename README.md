# OFF-CLIP: Improving Normal Detection Confidence in Radiology CLIP with Simple Off-Diagonal Term Auto-Adjustment

## About
OFF-CLIP (**OFF**-Diagonal **C**ontrastive **L**anguage-**I**mage **P**re-Training) is a pioneering refinement for radiology zero-shot classification, designed to boost normal case detection with minimal additional labeling. It leverages an innovative off-diagonal term loss to promote cohesive normal sample clustering while employing sentence-level text filtering to eliminate misaligned normal statements, thus reducing false negatives and positives.
